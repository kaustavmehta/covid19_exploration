# Data exploration of COVID-19 datasets

This is a repository for keeping everything that is relevant to my personal research project on exploring the global COVID-19 datasets that exist with geographical emphasis on India and a particular emphasis on biology and demographics. 

Please note: I am not an experienced programmer or a data scientist. Please do forgive me for poor quality code.
